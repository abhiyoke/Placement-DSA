Infix Notation
Infix notation is the common arithmetic and logical formula notation, where operators are placed between operands.
Example:
Expression: A + B
Infix: A + B

Prefix Notation (Polish Notation)
In prefix notation, the operator is placed before the operands. This notation doesn't require parentheses because the order of operations is always clear.
Example:
Expression: A + B
Prefix: + A B

Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation)
In postfix notation, the operator is placed after the operands. Like prefix notation, this also doesn't require parentheses because the order of operations is
always clear.
Example:
Expression: A + B
Postfix: A B +
