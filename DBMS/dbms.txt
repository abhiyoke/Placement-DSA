1.
File System:
Basic Concept: Data ko files mein store karta hai.
Data Management: Manual management, high redundancy aur inconsistency.
Data Access: Slow access due to manual searching.
Security: Limited security, manual protection.
DBMS:
Basic Concept: Systematic data storage in tables.
Data Management: Automatic management, low redundancy aur inconsistency.
Data Access: Fast access using SQL queries.
Security: High-level security with user authentication aur authorization.

2.ER model:
Entity: Real-world object (e.g., Student, Book).
Attributes: Characteristics of an entity (e.g., Name, Age).
Relationships: Connections between entities (e.g., Student borrows Book).
Diagram Components:
Rectangle: Entity.
Ellipse: Attribute.
Diamond: Relationship.
Lines: Connections.
ER Model se hum complex database designs ko easily visualize kar sakte hain aur relationships ko samajh sakte hain.

3.Types of Attributes
Simple Attribute: Cannot be divided (e.g., Roll Number).
Composite Attribute: Can be divided into sub-parts (e.g., Full Name).
Multivalued Attribute: Can have multiple values (e.g., Phone Numbers).
Derived Attribute: Calculated from other attributes (e.g., Age).
Key Attribute: Uniquely identifies the entity (e.g., Roll Number).

4.    Degree of Relationship:
Unary: Relationship with itself (e.g., Employee supervises Employee).
Binary: Relationship between two entities (e.g., Student enrolls in Course).
N-ary: Relationship among multiple entities (e.g., Doctor treats Patient in Hospital).
    Cardinality:
One to One (1:1): One entity to one entity (e.g., Person has Passport).
One to Many (1:M): One entity to multiple entities (e.g., Teacher teaches Students).
Many to Many (M:M): Multiple entities to multiple entities (e.g., Student enrolls in Courses).
   Participation:
Total Participation: All entities must participate (e.g., All Students enroll in at least one Course).
Partial Participation: Some entities participate (e.g., Some Employees have Parking Spots).

5.   Strong Entity:
Definition: Complete and can be uniquely identified independently.
Characteristics: Has primary key, not dependent on any other entity.
Example: Student (Roll Number), Book (ISBN).
     Weak Entity:
Definition: Incomplete and cannot be uniquely identified without a strong entity.
Characteristics: No primary key, but has partial key, dependent on strong entity.
//partial key:Partial key wo attribute ya set of attributes hota hai jo weak entity ko uniquely identify karne mein madad karta hai, lekin sirf strong entity ke key ke saath milkar hi ye possible hota hai.
Example: Dependent (Employee ID + Dependent Name), Order Item (Order Number + Item Number).  //Dependent are family members of emp.
    Diagram Explanation:
Strong Entity: Rectangle with underlined primary key.
Weak Entity: Double rectangle with dashed partial key.
Relationship: Diamond connecting weak entity to strong entity, with double lines indicating total participation.
