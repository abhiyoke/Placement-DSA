1.
File System:
Basic Concept: Data ko files mein store karta hai.
Data Management: Manual management, high redundancy aur inconsistency.
Data Access: Slow access due to manual searching.
Security: Limited security, manual protection.
DBMS:
Basic Concept: Systematic data storage in tables.
Data Management: Automatic management, low redundancy aur inconsistency.
Data Access: Fast access using SQL queries.
Security: High-level security with user authentication aur authorization.

2.ER model:
Entity: Real-world object (e.g., Student, Book).
Attributes: Characteristics of an entity (e.g., Name, Age).
Relationships: Connections between entities (e.g., Student borrows Book).
Diagram Components:
Rectangle: Entity.
Ellipse: Attribute.
Diamond: Relationship.
Lines: Connections.
ER Model se hum complex database designs ko easily visualize kar sakte hain aur relationships ko samajh sakte hain.

3.Types of Attributes
Simple Attribute: Cannot be divided (e.g., Roll Number).
Composite Attribute: Can be divided into sub-parts (e.g., Full Name).
Multivalued Attribute: Can have multiple values (e.g., Phone Numbers).
Derived Attribute: Calculated from other attributes (e.g., Age).
Key Attribute: Uniquely identifies the entity (e.g., Roll Number).

4.Degree of Relationship:
Unary: Relationship with itself (e.g., Employee supervises Employee).
Binary: Relationship between two entities (e.g., Student enrolls in Course).
N-ary: Relationship among multiple entities (e.g., Doctor treats Patient in Hospital).
Cardinality:
One to One (1:1): One entity to one entity (e.g., Person has Passport).
One to Many (1:M): One entity to multiple entities (e.g., Teacher teaches Students).
Many to Many (M:M): Multiple entities to multiple entities (e.g., Student enrolls in Courses).
Participation:
Total Participation: All entities must participate (e.g., All Students enroll in at least one Course).
Partial Participation: Some entities participate (e.g., Some Employees have Parking Spots).
